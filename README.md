# First Task for Brushless and Servo Motor

Brushless Motor
equipment for this task 
1-DC Motor 
2-Diode
3- Resistor 270 ohm 
4- NpN Transistor 
5- Arduino Uno R3
How to connect the Circuit?
1- connect the DC power (5V) to DC Motor 
2- connect the diode shunt with DC Motor 
3- connect the NPN Transistor (Emitter) to Ground (GND) on Arduino 
4- connect the Resistor to D9 in Ardunio after that Connect the Base in NPN to resistor 
5- connect Collector in NPN to diode (Anode) and DC Motor 
6- Coding the Arduino as you like 
For Example I am coding the Arduino to Control DC Motor speed
